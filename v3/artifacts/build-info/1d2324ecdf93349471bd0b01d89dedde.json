of the ERC20 Permit extension allowing approvals to be made via signatures, as defined in https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612[EIP-2612]. Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC20 allowance (see {IERC20-allowance}) by presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on `{IERC20-approve}`, the token holder account doesn't need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{\"DOMAIN_SEPARATOR()\":{\"details\":\"Returns the domain separator used in the encoding of the signature for `permit`, as defined by {EIP712}.\"},\"nonces(address)\":{\"details\":\"Returns the current nonce for `owner`. This value must be included whenever a signature is generated for {permit}. Every successful call to {permit} increases ``owner``'s nonce by one. This prevents a signature from being used multiple times.\"},\"permit(address,address,uint256,uint256,uint8,bytes32,bytes32)\":{\"details\":\"Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over `owner`'s tokens, given `owner`'s signed approval. IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction ordering also apply here. Emits an {Approval} event. Requirements: - `spender` cannot be the zero address. - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future. - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner` over the EIP712-formatted function arguments. - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).
